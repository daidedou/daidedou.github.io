We propose a novel framework for comparing 3D human shapes under the change of shape and pose. This problem is challenging since 3D human shapes vary significantly across subjects and body postures. We solve this problem by using a Riemannian approach. Our core contribution is the mapping of the human body surface to the space of metrics and normals. We equip this space with a family of Riemannian metrics, called Ebin (or DeWitt) metrics. We treat a human body surface as a point in a "shape space" equipped with a family of Riemmanian metrics. The family of metrics is invariant under rigid motions and reparametrizations; hence it induces a metric on the "shape space" of surfaces. Using the alignment of human bodies with a given template, we show that this family of metrics allows us to distinguish the changes in shape and pose. The proposed framework has several advantages. First, we define a family of metrics with desired invariant properties for the comparison of human shape. Second, we present an efficient framework to compute geodesic paths between human shape given the chosen metric. Third, this framework provides some basic tools for statistical shape analysis of human body surfaces. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework in pose and shape retrieval of human body.
