I am a Postdoc in University of Vienna under the supervision of Martin Bauer, until June 31. Before, I was a PhD student at Universit√© de Lille, supervised by Pr. Mohamed Daoudi and Pr. Juan Carlos Alvarez Paiva. My PhD is entitled: 3D and 4D Human body surface comparison and deformation: From geometric invariants to Riemannian shape analysis, where I studied geometric representations, in particular the tools of Riemannian shape analysis, for the comparison and deformation of human shapes.
