I am actually a Postdoc at the LIX laboratory at Ecole Polytechnique. I work with Pr. Maks Ovsjanikov, working on generative modeling for non-rigid deformable shapes.

Before, I worked with Pr. Mohamed Daoudi and Pr. Ali Amad on objective assessment of depressive patients (CALYPSO project, September-December 2023), and even before (April-July 2023), made a short Postdoc in University of Vienna under the supervision of Martin Bauer, working on Riemannian analysis of non-rigid deformable shapes. 

I was a PhD student at Universit√© de Lille, supervised by Pr. Mohamed Daoudi and Pr. Juan Carlos Alvarez Paiva. My PhD is entitled: 3D and 4D Human body surface comparison and deformation: From geometric invariants to Riemannian shape analysis. In this thesis, I studied geometric representations, in particular the tools of Riemannian shape analysis, for the comparison and deformation of human shapes.

My research interests lies in shape analysis, geometric deep learning and more generally computer vision and machine learning.
