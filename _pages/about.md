I am actually a research engineer at CHU de Lille, where I work with Pr. Mohamed Daoudi and Pr. Ali Amad on objective assessment of depressive patients (CALYPSO project). Before, I made a short Postdoc in University of Vienna under the supervision of Martin Bauer, working on Riemannian deformable shapes analysis. 

I was a PhD student at Universit√© de Lille, supervised by Pr. Mohamed Daoudi and Pr. Juan Carlos Alvarez Paiva. My PhD is entitled: 3D and 4D Human body surface comparison and deformation: From geometric invariants to Riemannian shape analysis. In this thesis, I studied geometric representations, in particular the tools of Riemannian shape analysis, for the comparison and deformation of human shapes.

My research interests lies in shape analysis, geometric deep learning and more generally computer vision and machine learning.
