### Small recap

Let an input shape $\mathcal{S}$, we wish to find the correspondance between this shape and a template shape $\mathcal{T}$. 

We do it using functional map. A functional map is a linear map between the function space $\mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}$ and $\mathcal{T} \to \mathbb{R}$. 

Let $\Phi_\mathcal{S} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n_S}$, $\Phi_\mathcal{T} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n_T}$, the Laplace eigenvectors of both shapes. The functional map can be represented as a matrix $C$ taking coefficient in $S$ basis to the ones in $T$ basis.

Functional map work by matching features in the eigenbasis, but often fails because of underlying symmetry

Suppose now we have a shape diffusion model (here it is in PCA coefficient space). Can we regularize those results with diffusion models?

## Proposed approach

![&nbsp; ](images/fig_explanation.png);

## Transfer to template connectivity

We transfer the coordinates by convert the matrix $C_{S \to T}$ to a point to point map $\Pi_{S \to T}$.


$$
F(X_S, C) = \Pi_{S \to T}^C X_S,
$$ 
where 
$$
\Pi_{S \to T}^C (p, q) = \frac{\exp(-\delta_{pq}*\alpha)}{\sum_q {\exp(-\delta_{pq}*\alpha)}},
$$

with $\delta_{pq} = ||\Phi_T(q) - C\Phi_S(p)||²$

Train a pose + shape model -> changed

What happens with a ground-truth fmap?

Other experiments with ground-truth

Add some usual functional maps loss (orthogonality/others)

### First experiment: replace SDS with ground-truth

Given our transfer function $F(X_S, C)$  we suppose we know $X_{S \to T}^{\text{gt}} = F(X_S, C_{\text{gt}})$. Starting from a noisy $C$, can we recover $C_{\text{gt}}$ from $X_{S \to T}^{\text{gt}}$, by minimizing the loss below ?

$$
||  F(X_S, C) - X_{S \to T}^{\text{gt}} || ²
$$

No. But if we add a new term to the loss we want to minimize. Given the transferred vertices $X_{\mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{T}}$, we compute the point correspondance in the spatial coordinates (+normals, to avoid erros when parts are gluing to each other). We then extract a functional map based on this correspondance, $C_{\text{spatial}}$, and minimize: 

$$
\mathcal{L}_{proper} = || C - C_{\text{spatial}}||^2
$$

With this supplementary loss, the functional map converges.

## Example {.scrollable}

From left to right: transferred vertices, texture map, map matrix (first 40 coordinates), distance to ground truth functional map.

No additional loss:

Additional loss $\mathcal{L}_{proper}$:
![](videos/fusion_dist.mp4)

## Full losses {.smaller}

We also force the PCA reconstruction to be close to the converted vertices.

$$
\mathcal{L}_{res} = ||\text{Rec}(X_{PCA}) - X_{S \to T} ||²
$$

Finally, we encourage the matrix to be orthogonal (~ area preserving map) via

$$
\mathcal{L}_{ortho}= || CC^T - I||^2
$$

The full loss optimized is:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{SDS} + \mathcal{L}_{proper} + \mathcal{L}_{res} + 0.1 * \mathcal{L}_{ortho}
$$
