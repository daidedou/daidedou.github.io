## The conference 

- Nashville : better than expected
- 2 days of workshops/tutorials/seminars
- 3 days of posters/orals/keynotes
- Many people
- Trends: Foundation/Multimodal/Video models, diffusion models, Mamba
- Downsides: political context, posters on sunday

## Workshops

- Equivariant Vision: From Theory to Practice ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wME-8fEBb-w&t=11538s); recommended talk: Vincent Sitzmann at 3:12:00)
- Shape analysis
- Computer vision in sports ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loVhCUW-xHk); recommended talk: Roland Memisevic at 10:51)
- Also: Meta Keynote ([video](https://youtu.be/NWf9-ccdm-g): "cycle" of training a "Frontier" LLM)

## Paper pattern

- Pick an "unsolved" "2D images -> something" task

## Paper pattern

- Pick an "unsolved" "2D images -> something" task
- Generate/collect/build a dataset of ground truth (doesn't have to be too big) -> actually quite hard

## Paper pattern

- Pick an "unsolved" "2D images -> something" task
- Generate/collect/build a dataset of ground truth (doesn't have to be too big) -> actually quite hard
- Use "foundation" features (e.g. Dino) as input of your model solution

## Paper pattern

- Pick an "unsolved" "2D images -> something" task
- Generate/collect/build a dataset of ground truth (can be synthetic, doesn't have to be too big) -> actually quite hard
- Use "foundation" features (e.g. Dino) as input of your model solution

Even if your dataset is far from real data or is small scale, your solution will generalize a lot
